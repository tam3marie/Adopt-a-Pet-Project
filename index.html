        Lexi and I met like most great loves today, online! 🤣 I first saw her
        adorable picture on pet finder. I was looking for a best buddy and sweet
        little baby. Adoption was the only option, of course, because it's the
        best option! <br /><br />
        When I went to meet her, it was love at first sight! 😍🐶 I went to the
        car to take a call, and when I returned she jumped up on the fence
        wagging her tail and gave me a look of,
        <em>"Let's get outta here, Mum!"</em><br /><span class="mine">
          💜 She was mine! 💜</span
        ><br /><br />
        For the last nine years she has been my baby and my best friend. It's us
        against the world! We've shared laughs, food (that little beggar),
        walks, drives, adventures, naps and everything in between. It continues
        to be a beautiful friendship every day.<br /><br />
        Find out how you can adopt your<br />best friend below! 🐶😺
